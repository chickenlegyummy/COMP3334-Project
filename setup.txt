# COMP3334 Project Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up and run the file storage server and client, and add new users.

---

## Step 1: Install Python
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
- Check by typing `python --version` in your terminal/command prompt.
- If not installed, download it from python.org and install it.

---

## Step 2: Set Up the Project
1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Go to the project folder:
cd C:\path\to\COMP3334-Project
3. Install required packages:
pip install cryptography
---

## Step 3: Run the Server
1. Start the server:
python -m src.server.server
2. Youâ€™ll see "Server running on port 5000..." if it works.
- The server stores files in a "storage" folder and user info in "users.db".
- Default users:
- Admin: username "admin", password "adminpassword"
- Normal: username "test", password "password"
- Normal: username "test2", password "test2pass"
- Normal: username "test3" and "test4", password "Test123."

## Step 4: Run the Client
1. Open a new terminal/command prompt.
2. Go to the project folder:
cd C:\path\to\COMP3334-Project
3. Edit `src/client/client.py`:
- Change `SERVER_HOST = "your.server.ip.here"` to `SERVER_HOST = "127.0.0.1"` if testing on your computer.
4. Start the client:
python -m src.client.client
5. Log in with a username and password (e.g., "test" and "password").
6. Use commands like `upload`, `download`, `list`, `delete`, `edit`, or `exit`.

---

## Step 5: Add New Users (Admin Only)
1. In a terminal, go to the project folder:
cd C:\path\to\COMP3334-Project
2. Run the registration tool:
python -m src.server.register
3. Follow the prompts:
- Enter a new username (e.g., "newuser").
- Enter a password (e.g., "newpass123").
- Choose a role: "admin", "normal", or "guest".
- Example:
Enter username (or 'exit' to quit): newuser
Enter password: newpass123
Enter role (admin/normal/guest): normal
User 'newuser' registered successfully with role 'normal'!
4. Type "exit" to finish.
- New users can now log in with the client.

---

## Tips
- To start fresh, delete the "storage" folder and "users.db" file.
- If you get errors, check your terminal for messages and make sure the server is running before starting the client.
- Use `list` to see files, `edit` to change who can see them, and `download` to get files.

Enjoy using the file storage system!
